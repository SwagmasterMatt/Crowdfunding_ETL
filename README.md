# Crowdfunding_ETL Introduction
  In this project we will be building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary mthods to extract and transform data. After the data is transformed, we created four CSV files to assist in creating an ERD and table schema.

# Creating the DataFrames

# Creating the Crowdfunding Database

# Methodology

# Crowdfunding Database
- To start creating the databse we sketched an ERD of the tables using the four CSV files.
- This sketch was created using QuickDBD. You can access QuickDBD by following this link: http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
